# <h1><center>ELECTRONIC NOSE FOR DETECTION OF DEFECTS IN COFFEE HARDWARE</center></h1>


## **- DESIGN**
#### The design proposed for the general structure of the electronic nose system is shown in the following figure. This scheme has five items, which are developed sequentially for the evaluation of the viability of the system in the detection of a coffee sample

* **Mounting Infrastructure**
#### As for the infrastructure of the electronic nose system an experiment was conducted to determine if the sensors should be isolated and contained in a space.Starting from the results it is determined that the physical infrastructure must be composed of two spaces: a camera of concentration where a sample of coffee and a measuring chamber can be housed and isolated where all volatile compound detectors will be. These chambers must be constructed of a odorless material and at the same time allow the accommodation of a cup.

* **Array Sensors**
### Initially the use of electrochemical sensors of the MQ family has been defined. For the choice of the quantity and specificity of the sensors, the analog MQ sensors to the research developed by (Rodríguez, Durán and Reyes, 2009) described in Table 1. in Rodriguez's investigation eight were used electrochemical sensors of the FIGARO brand of various applications obtaining favorable results for the detection of ferment, repose, pasilla and excelso in Coffee samples.Indeed. 
### It is desired to determine if the MQ sensors respond just like the sensors FIGARO to a sample of coffee.

### For the physical distribution of the sensors there is no architecture defined in the state of art.
### The following figure shows this sensor distribution design.

## * **Data acquisition system**
### A circuit with the dimensions of 6 cm was designed. X 8 cm in the following Figure. For take full advantage of the space and overlap this plate at the top of the Raspberry P-3.
